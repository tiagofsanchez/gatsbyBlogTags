## Playing with Gatsby to better understand Tags

The idea of this Repo is very simple! I wanted to test out and learn how to create tags and the correspondent pages for blog posts in Gatsby. 

Things that I have done and learnt here: 
- Making sure that the markdown works and formatting is fine 
- Adding a list of posts in `index.js`
- Build the slugs dynamically in `gatsby-node.js`
- Build a blog post template
- Create pages for the Tags
- Render the posts in the correct Tag page


The end goal would be to implement that in my Blog where I am using `gatsby-theme-blog`.
